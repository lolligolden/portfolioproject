Letricia Golden Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio page for Letricia Golden.  As I am new to web development, I kept it simple using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.  The projects included are a simple webpage to 
introduce people to some of the more famous works of Vincent Van Gogh, using Bootstrap.  The other project is my attempt to copy the Google homepage.  
Below, is a screenshot of the portfolio page

As I continue on my learning journey, I hope to be able to revise my page and projects to update some of the items I didn't quite know how to 
implement on the Google Homepage and add some games or animations to my portfolio and projects page.
