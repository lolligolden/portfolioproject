            <ul>
                <li>I was born in Austin, TX.</li>
                <li>Currently, I also live in Austin, TX.</li>
                <li>My career for the last 20+ years has been in the science industry working 
                    for various laboratories. The past 3 years has been in healthcare.</li>
                <li>I was hoping to be a traveling Medical Lab Technician but the healthcare industry has not been what I was hoping for, 
                    so I am exploring Software Development as a new career field, and I have enjoyed what I am learning so far. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>I love to watch movies, but I haven't been to the movie theater for a while.  
                    It's just easier to watch things at home since the COVID pandemic.</li>
                <li>I like to learn different things, and it seems like every year I end up taking up knitting. 
                    I finally, finished a whole sweater last year, though.</li>
                <li>I enjoy listening to books on tape about getting out of debt and getting my finances in order.</li>
                <li>I also really like gardening and being outdoors when I can.
                    Here is a picture of me outdoors with my sister's dog, Honey. I like to call her
                    <em>Honey Bunny</em>, because she hops around the yard like a bunny rabbit.

            <ul>
                <li>I am also intersted in traveling more, as I mentioned in the about me section.  
                    My top destinations would be Hawaii, New Zealand, and Canada.</li>
                <li>Next year, my family will be going on a cruise to Hawaii for Christmas.</li>
                <li>I love sea turtles, and I really hope to see one just like in the video below.</li>
